Lopita and I went over the Medicare dictionary and came to these conclusions.

1) Part D contract should be changed to:
		null/N/0 = no prescription drug coverage
		Any other value - yes prescription drug coverage
2) Part C contract ID - determines if member has part C coverage or not
		N = use buy-in indicator
		any other value = yes part C
