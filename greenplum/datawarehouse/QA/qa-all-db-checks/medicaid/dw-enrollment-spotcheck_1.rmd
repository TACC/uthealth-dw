#Purpose:
This R markdown script examines the accuracy of conversions from raw source tables to
data_warehouse tables

It selects random rows from the dw_staging yearly enrollment table and compares
them to a table that is created using (mostly) the same logic from the SPC-side tables.


# SECTION 0: Loading required packages, making connections, the usual

## 0.1 Load packages
```{r package-loading, warning = FALSE}
# Package installs/loading 

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(DBI, odbc, rstudioapi, keyring, openxlsx, tidyverse, beepr, tictoc, here)

```

## 0.2 Connect to TACC
```{r connect-to-tacc}
#PREREQUISITE: Set up your username/password in Keyring
# Instructions: replace indicated areas in code below with your username/password for TACC server
# Run it once, and delete from code - code will not need to be run more than once per user per computer
# Keyring will save your username/password to your OS credential store, and the service/user/password combo
# can be retrieved without hardcoding a password or requring user input.
# key_set_with_value(service = "Greenplum", 
#                   username = "-----------", #replace with your username
#                   password = "-----------") #replace with your password


#Connect to Greenplum
tac <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
	 dsn = "PostgreSQL30",
	 database = "uthealth",
	 UID = "xrzhang",
	 PWD = key_get("Greenplum", "xrzhang"),
	 host = "greenplum01.corral.tacc.utexas.edu",
	 port = 5432)
```

## 0.3 Connect to SPC
```{r connect-to-spcdedpwpvs1}
#PREREQUISITE: Set up connection to SPCDEDPWPVS1 in ODBC Data sources
#Make sure the default schema is correct! This one is set to medicaid

#Connect to SPCDEDPWPVS1
spc <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
	 dsn = "medicaid")
```

## 0.4 Clear R environment (except for DB connections)
```{r clear-environment}
# clears R environment except for DB connections
rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("tac", "spc")))
```

## 0.5 Set print to 25 rows
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, rows.print=25)

```

# SECTION 1: Define global variables

```{r}
#Define the starting and ending years for checking (4-digit year)
starting_year = 2012
ending_year = 2021

#Define how many rows to check per year
rows_to_check = '500000'

#Define how many sets of errors to print out per year
records_to_print = 5

#convert to 2-digit year
starting_yr = starting_year - 2000
ending_yr = ending_year - 2000
```

# SECTION 2: Compare SPC and TACC tables
## 2.1 Pull TACC data and upload to SPC
```{r}
tac_sql = 'with b as (select race_cd_src, race_cd from reference_tables.ref_race
	where data_source = \'mdcd\' and race_cd_src is not null)

select a.data_source, a.member_id_src, a.year, a.total_enrolled_months, a.gender_cd,
b.race_cd_src, a.age_derived, a.dob_derived, a.zip5, a.plan_type, a.dual, a.htw
from dw_staging.member_enrollment_yearly a left join b
	on a.race_cd = b.race_cd
order by random()
limit @rows_to_check;'

tac_sql.mod = tac_sql %>% gsub('@rows_to_check', rows_to_check, .)
tac_selection = dbGetQuery(tac, tac_sql.mod)

dbGetQuery(spc, 'drop table if exists work.dbo.xz_dwqa_temp1;')
dbWriteTable(spc, SQL('work.dbo.xz_dwqa_temp1'), tac_selection)

```
## 2.2 Make boolean table of mismatches
```{sql, connection = spc}
--Make boolean table of matches
drop table if exists work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_mismatches;

select a.member_id_src as member_id, a.year,
	case when b.mem_id is null then 1 else 0 end as member_id_mismatch,
	case when a.total_enrolled_months != b.enrolled_months then 1 else 0 end as em_mismatch,
	case when a.gender_cd != b.sex then 1 else 0 end as sex_mismatch,
	case when a.race_cd_src != b.race and b.race is not null then 1 else 0 end as race_mismatch,
	case when a.dob_derived != b.dob then 1 else 0 end as dob_mismatch,
	case when a.zip5 != b.zip then 1 else 0 end as zip_mismatch,
	case when a.plan_type != b.mco then 1 else 0 end as plan_mismatch,
	case when a.dual !=  b.smib then 1 else 0 end as dual_mismatch,
	case when a.htw != b.htw then 1 else 0 end as htw_mismatch,
	a.gender_cd as tacc_sex, b.sex as spc_sex,
	a.race_cd_src as tacc_race, b.race as spc_race,
	a.zip5 as tacc_zip, b.zip as spc_zip,
	a.plan_type as tacc_plan, b.mco as spc_plan
into work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_mismatches
from work.dbo.xz_dwqa_temp1 a
	left join work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_cy_reconciled b
	on a.member_id_src = b.mem_id and a.year = b.cy;

```

##2.3 Calculate the sum of errors
```{sql, connection = spc, output.var = sum_errors}

select sum(member_id_mismatch) as member_id_mismatches,
	sum(em_mismatch) as em_mismatches,
	sum(sex_mismatch) as sex_mismatches,
	sum(race_mismatch) as race_mismatches,
	sum(dob_mismatch) as dob_mismatches,
	sum(zip_mismatch) as zip_mismatches,
	sum(plan_mismatch) as plan_mismatches,
	sum(dual_mismatch) as dual_mismatches,
	sum(htw_mismatch) as htw_mismatches
from work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_mismatches;


```


# SECTION 3: Closer look at what's going wrong
## 3.1: Pull mismatches
```{r}
#SEX, RACE, ZIP, AND PLAN HAVE MISMATCHES
#Pull lists of mismatches

sex_mismatches = dbGetQuery(spc, 'select member_id, year
              from work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_mismatches
              where sex_mismatch = 1;')

race_mismatches = dbGetQuery(spc, 'select member_id, year
              from work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_mismatches
              where race_mismatch = 1;')

zip_mismatches = dbGetQuery(spc, 'select member_id, year
              from work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_mismatches
              where zip_mismatch = 1;')

              from work.dbo.xz_mcd_enrl_mismatches
              where plan_mismatch = 1;')

```

## 3.2 Define base queries
```{r}
#Define base queries

```

## 3.4 Define the function to get mismatch info
```{r}
