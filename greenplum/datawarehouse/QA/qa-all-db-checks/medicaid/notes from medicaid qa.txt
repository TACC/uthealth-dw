Data Process:
Monthly:

Place cleaned and transformed variables into temporary table dw_staging.medicaid_enroll_etl
Update reference table values
Get most frequent birthday value, in case of ties, most recent wins, update column so same bday for all values in tables
Delete duplicate records with multiple plan types according to hierarchy

Insert into dw_staging.member_enrollment_monthly
Create consecutive months enrolled

Yearly:
Insert variables where most common is not needed into dw_staging.member_enrollment_monthly
Update flag variables for each column about which months they were enrolled 
Update variables that may have multiple values during a year: take by order count, most recent


------QA--------

General stuff:
The sum of enrollment months in yearly table should == the number of records in monthly
	PASS sum_em from yearly = row_count from monthly = 580538199
The sum of distinct people of course should be same in enrollment of course
	PASS distinct_member_yearly = distinct_members_monthly = 13005054

Count (distinct ppl | month-yr) == count(*) in dw_staging.monthly_enrollment 
	PASS distinct combinations of member-month-year from yearly enrollment match row_count from monthy enrollment

Because there are overlapping records in chip and enrl and duplicate records at the monthly data in medicaid data, the counts should not be the same between raw data and dw enrollment tables

However, the count for distinct people || month year id is the same

Existential:
Or, for every person || month year, the same record should exist in monthly_enrollment 
All client numbers exist in enrollment under member_id_src

To check against source data: union enrl, chip_uth, and htw

Overall agreement level - age and sex  

QAing the variables might be a bit weird since it will not match jeff's tables
We are following the ordering by count / most recent to assign variables from match 

Claims checking:

check distinct ICNs
check what percentage of ICNs are orphaned

-- Medicaid plan type heirarchy

CHIP
Star Kids
STAR+PLUS
Star Health
STAR
MMP
FFS

Things to fix in data_warehouse code:
SMIB indicates dual membership
ME_CODE = 'W' indicates membership in HTW
Take out HTW from enrollment tables? What to do with them?

*ONE MORE ISSUE:
The ref_race table needs to be 1-1, or else this issue arises:

select a.data_source, a.member_id_src, a.year, a.total_enrolled_months, a.gender_cd, a.race_cd, 
case when a.race_cd in ('1', '2', '4', '5', '6') then b.race_cd_src else '6' end as race_cd,
a.age_derived, a.dob_derived, a.zip5, a.plan_type, a.dual, a.htw
from dw_staging.member_enrollment_yearly a left join reference_tables.ref_race b
	on a.race_cd = b.race_cd and a.data_source = b.data_source 
limit 20;

Things to discuss in a general setting:

ENROLLMENT TABLES
1) Do we want separate FY and CY tables?
2) HTW - include or do not include in enrollment tables?
	if no include, then where?
3) plan type logic - verify that this is correct
	CHIP > STAR*NAMED* > STAR > MMP/FFS/PCCM
4) Unknown vs known: do we prioritize known?
	Example: member is 'U' for 11 months out of the year and 'M' for 1 month. Is s/he male?
5) Assigning plan types:
	Example: member has the following enrollment:
	elig_date		plan_type
	201301			STAR
	201302			STAR
	201303			FFS
	201304			FFS
	201305			FFS
	201306			FFS
	201306			STAR
	
	data_warehouse currently cleans the data on monthly level (applies priority for plan type)
	so 201306 would have plan type of STAR:
	elig_date		plan_type
	201301			STAR
	201302			STAR
	201303			FFS
	201304			FFS
	201305			FFS
	201306			STAR
	
	Because there is a tie (3 months FFS/3 months STAR) and STAR is the most recent,
	data_warehouse logic says that STAR is the plan type.
	
	However, in the raw data, the member actually has 4 months of FFS and 3 months of STAR.
	
	Note: This problem applies to a very small minority of cases (< .5%)
	Note2: Because deletion of rows occurs, this also generates mismatches for other variables. The rate of mismatch is EXTREMELY low, <0.01%
	
	
DIAG TABLES
1) FROM_DOS is currently taken from the CLM_HEADER HDR_FROM_DOS column - this is the DOS when the claim was opened, not necessarily the DOS for the particular DX
	However, the advantage of using HDR_FROM_DOS is that it is a lot cleaner, with very few out of range dates
	The DOS from CLAIM_DETAILS is more precise, but dirtier, with dates that are clearly out of range
	
PROC TABLES
1) Prior to the ICD-9/10 changeover, procedure codes have an extra 0 padded in the front (ICD-9 proc codes are supposed to be numeric with 3-4 digits)
Should we strip the leading 0?
PROs: matches actual codes, is less easy to confuse with CPT/HCSPCS codes
CONs: requires change

HEADER TABLES
1) Verify this is correct:
		clm_header.atd_prov_npi maps to ref_provider on data_warehouse
		enc_header.attd_phy_npi maps to perf_at_provider on data_warehouse
 
DETAIL TABLES
1) sub_proc_cd is currently being used to supplment the proc_cd column. It replaces proc_cd if proc_cd is missing or invalid.
	This means that if there is both a VALID proc_cd and a valid sub_proc_cd, sub_proc_cd does not get included in the detail tables in data_warehouse
	The sub_proc_cd column ONLY exists in clm tables in Medicaid
	Note that other data sources do not have a sub_proc_cd column so it'll be a largely null column if we choose to add it
	
	A little more about the PROC and SUB_PROC_CDs
	Top 5 most frequent SUB_PROC_CDs are:
		SUB		FREQ
		T1019	86498475		T1019 	Personal Care Attendant (15 mins = 1 unit)
		92508	16441508		92508	Under Treatment of Auditory Processing Disorder
		T1502	 5364771		T1502	Administration of oral, intramuscular and/or subcutaneous
								medication by health care agency/professional, per visit
		92507	 2058108		92507	Under Treatment of Auditory Processing Disorder
		T1015	 2050913		T1015	Clinic visit/encounter, all-inclusive
	
	They seem to travel in pairs, and the top 5 proc_cd | sub_proc_cd pairs are:
		PROC  SUB   FREQ
		7049X T1019	61594530		<--These X codes don't come up when I search
		7051X T1019	18951120
		7025X 92508	10947261
		7048X T1019	5836602
		7026X 92508	5490137
		7052X T1502	3802824
		7021X 92507	1375746
		Z9813 T1015	1100227			Z9813 FQHC ENCOUNTER (This I got off of a HTW pdf)
		7042X T1002	991343
		7053X T1502	922594
		7022X 92507	678647
		A0020 A0425	649477			A0020 is a deleted code? But A0425 is Ground mileage, per statute mile
		7055X T1502	639353
		7039X 97530	587793
		Z9813 G0467	546759
		
2) Units : Are integers in CLM tables and are floats in ENC tables. However, data_warehouse stores them as ints, so when they get transferred over, they are coerced to int.

RX TABLES (Pharmacy claims)
1) do we need a month_year_id column
2) for 2012 and 2013, there's a CHIP_RX table, an FFS_RX table, and a CHIP_FFS_RX table on the SPC server.
	The information in the CHIP_FFS_RX table does not exist on TACC. Is this ok and also what's the reason
	for excluding this information?
3) rx_qty is a float in raw data/SPC and is coerced to int in dw_staging
