#PREREQUISITE: Set up your username/password in Keyring
# Instructions: replace indicated areas in code below with your username/password for TACC server
# Run it once, and delete from code - code will not need to be run more than once per user per computer
# Keyring will save your username/password to your OS credential store, and the service/user/password combo
# can be retrieved without hardcoding a password or requring user input.
# key_set_with_value(service = "Greenplum",
#                   username = "-----------", #replace with your username
#                   password = "-----------") #replace with your password
# Function for connecting to TACC/Greenplum
# TACC kicks you out for inactivity so just call function before connections
